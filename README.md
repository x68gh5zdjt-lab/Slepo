# 🎮 How the Game Works
You gotta **play Minecraft in class** to gain **Aura**.  
And trust me—**Aura is everything**. Stack as much of it as you can.

# Games type
Arcade / simulation
 
# ✨ Gaining (and Losing) Aura
 
You can gain Aura by:
- 🟩 Playing Minecraft  
- 😎 Playing **Minecraft in front of your classmates** (they respect the grind)
 
You **lose Aura** if:
- 😬 You play lowkey (lame behavior)
 
⚠️ **Warning:**  
Your teachers **do NOT understand us**.  
If they catch you playing Minecraft, they will **KILL you** 💀 (in-game, obviously).
 
# 🏆 Objective
 
Your goal in this **Cool game** is simple:
 
> **Get as much Aura as possible before getting caught.**
 
Can you do it?  
Or are you **lame =/**

# Why We Chose [This Game Type]
- It reflect who we are as individuals and us as WECIB. Thank you for the happiest years of my life.
 
# Scope Decisions
## prioritize
- The game has to increase in aura points when you play. The game has to end if the teachers catch you.
## defer
- Some teachers give you extra aura points
- You can trade aura point for upgrades
 
# Incomplete Features
[Upgrades]: lack of time, Complete in next sprint if time permits <br>
[Tutorial]: Not implemented because of readme, low priority
 
# Recommendations for QA
- Test all player inputs
- Look for errors in game loop
- Check win/lose conditions under weird circumstances
